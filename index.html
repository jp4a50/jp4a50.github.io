<b>Hi. I'm Jon. Welcome to my site.</b>
<p>
I'm a software engineer living and (usually) working in London. I've worked for <a href="https://improbable.io">Improbable</a> and Amazon Video in the past and am currently taking a career break.
<p>
In my spare time I work out, go to gigs, travel and occasionally attempt to play musical instruments (badly).
<p>
Feel free to take a look around the site or <a href="mailto:jonap2811@gmail.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer me">ping me an email</a>. I promise that I might reply at some point.
